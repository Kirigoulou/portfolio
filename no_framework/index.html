            <p>
                I’m an engineering student passionate about embedded systems, low-level programming, and building
                reliable software that bridges hardware and software. I particularly enjoy working close to the
                machine, where attention to detail and efficiency are critical, whether it’s firmware, drivers, or
                operating system concepts.
            </p>

            <p>
                Currently, I’m in my final year at EPITA (Paris, France), specializing in computer engineering. I’ve
                strengthened my expertise in embedded development through projects involving microcontrollers,
                communication protocols, and real-time systems. I also had the opportunity to study abroad at California
                State University, Los Angeles, where I deepened my knowledge in computer science in an international
                environment.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the past, I interned at Institut Curie, where I developed a web application to monitor radiotherapy
                machines, gaining valuable experience in delivering impactful engineering solutions. I’ve also worked on
                several technical projects, such as writing a driver for the MPU6050 on STM32, designing an ISO9660
                filesystem parser in C, and experimenting with kernel development, which reinforced my understanding of
                both embedded and system-level software.
